If I was a girl I would wear a miniskirt into town,
And to keep you by my side, never let you go home
I count all the things that make me wonder why
The pretty ones seem to get fucked up all the time

I began lifting my legs over railway tracks,
You just don't know when you might get hit by a truck
I ate all the food which should have lasted two weeks
She said it's harder to talk about the good things
Now that you're here

Better off on your own,
When things get tough just take a rest

And I felt stronger even though
And I felt stronger even though
Yeah you make me feel low, so low

If I was a girl I would wear a miniskirt into town
And to keep you by my side and never let you go home
I count all the things that make me wonder why
The pretty ones seem to get fucked up all the time

You're better off on your own,
When things get tough just take a rest
You're better off on your own
When things get tough just take a rest.
