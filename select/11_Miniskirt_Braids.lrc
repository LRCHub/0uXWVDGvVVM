[00:01.74] It's not like I'm feeling much different
[00:06.36] Than a woman my age
[00:08.17] Years ago
[00:09.99] Liberated is what you wanna call it
[00:13.58] How about unfairly choked
[00:18.22] Cause I know some just see my body
[00:21.82] And every girl I know at some point stopped eating
[00:27.08] I am not a man hater
[00:28.88] I enjoy them like cake
[00:33.30] But in my position
[00:35.10] I'm the slut
[00:36.07] I'm the bitch
[00:36.93] I'm the whore
[00:37.87] The one you hate
[00:40.52] And there's a name for this kind of man
[00:43.25] A soft one at that
[00:45.05] Womanizer
[00:45.98] Casanova
[00:46.97] Lothario
[00:50.56] For us it's just a stamp to the head
[00:54.17] For them another notch in the bed
[00:56.86] It's like I'm wearing red
[00:58.72] And if I am
[00:59.61] You feel you've the right to touch me
[01:03.25] Cause I asked for it
[01:05.04] In my little mini skirt
[01:08.68] Think you can have it
[01:13.25] My little mini skirt
[01:17.79] It's mine all mine
[01:26.79] 
[02:20.52] I know what it's like
[02:23.28] To have everything
[02:27.73] Taken away from me and my family
[02:35.98] For there was once a man
[02:39.55] Proposing to love all of us
[02:44.93] Instead he is full of hate
[02:49.47] Towards himself
[02:50.37] Towards his bait
[02:52.15] And everything he touches is for him
[02:55.76] My mother's soul he devours with a grin
[02:59.46] And when she finds out
[03:03.05] The child he has taken
[03:04.86] Confronts him
[03:05.72] Stakes him
[03:06.69] Breaks him
[03:07.53] All our boxes on the lawn
[03:12.05] Woman shelter for 9 months
[03:15.64] Cross the street to the church
[03:19.28] Pray confusedly about what hurts
[03:22.93] Enough to start
[03:23.82] A new beginning for us both
[03:27.44] I thank you Canada
[03:35.10] Thank you Canada
[03:43.10] 
[03:41.58] We are all going
[03:45.17] Going
[03:46.92] Never knowing
[03:49.63] What we had
[03:50.52] Until it's gone
[03:58.02] 
[04:12.21] It's my little mini skirt
[04:15.09] Think you can have it
[04:19.51] My little mini skirt
[04:23.13] It's mine all mine
