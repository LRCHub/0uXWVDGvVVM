[00:12.34] I was standing on the corner of a big windy city
[00:16.80] When I spot a chick she was looking nitty-pretty
[00:20.86] My knees they started shaking and my head began to jerk
[00:24.71] I've got to know that girl in the miniskirt
[00:46.21] 
[00:28.27] I've got those going to a go-go, working on my mojo
[00:32.93] Checking out those miniskirt blues
[00:49.93] 
[00:38.28] Well she walked up to me and said daddy what's doing
[00:42.51] I can tell by her smile that evil was a'brewlin'
[00:46.74] She said the man was Jessabel, Miss Jessabel Hurt
[00:50.62] That foxy little momma in the miniskirt
[01:10.12] 
[00:54.11] I've got those going to a go-go, working on my mojo
[00:58.96] Checking out those miniskirt blues
[01:15.96] 
[01:03.96] Play the blues now
[01:12.96]

[01:41.31] 
[01:29.87] Well, we went to cabaret where everything was a moving
[01:34.42] The Chick got up and she started grooving
[01:38.59] She did the coffee grind and the double o'blurt
[01:42.33] That tantolizing temptress in the miniskirt
[02:03.83] 
[01:45.72] I've got those going to a go-go, working on my mojo
[01:50.87] Checking out those miniskirt blues
[02:07.87] 
[01:55.69] Yeah I've got those going to a go-go, working on my mojo
[02:00.70] Checking out those miniskirt blues
[02:17.70]
